The first Geoscience Hackathon, organized by the Jackson School of Geosciences and the Open-Souce Program Office at the University of Texas at Austin, took place on **October 4-6, 2024** at the Scholars Lab of the Perry-Castañeda Library. ConocoPhillips and Sandia National Labs sponsored the event.

The theme of the hackathon was computational reproducibility. Around 20 students split into teams and worked on creative projects reproducing and extending computational results from previously published classic geoscience papers.

A panel of external judges evaluated the results.
