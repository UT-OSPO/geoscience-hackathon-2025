The second annual Geoscience Hackathon, organized by the Jackson School of Geosciences and the Open-Source Program Office at the University of Texas at Austin, took place on **October 10-12, 2025** at the Scholars Lab of the Perry-Castañeda Library. 

ConocoPhillips and Sandia National Labs sponsored the event.

The theme of the hackathon was **change over time**. Around 20 students split into teams and worked on creative projects analyzing changes in Earth’s systems that happen both in real-time and over millions of years in geological time. 

A panel of external judges evaluated the results.
